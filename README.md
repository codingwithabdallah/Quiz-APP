# Quiz-APP
## A simple JavaScript quiz app to test your basic knowledge with interactive questions and answers

This project is a simple JavaScript-based quiz app that helps users test their basic knowledge through interactive questions and answers. This quiz app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages these languages to create the app's structure, styling, and functionality, respectively. The app starts with a "Start" button and, upon clicking, displays a series of multiple-choice questions. Each question has four clickable options, and users can navigate through questions using "Next" buttons. This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic logic implementation in JavaScript
